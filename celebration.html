        <h3>
            You Wanted Emotion, Here You
        </h3>
        
        <p>
            One step, two step, three step, four.
        </p>

        <p>
            What does our world so empowered have in store?
        </p>

        <p>
            Let this serve as but a tour
        </p>

        <p>
            that beneath the canon lies an undiscovered lore
        </p>

        <p>
            Indeed, popular are cautionary tales that expound the perils of the night; the perils of the shadows; the perils of the figures that lurk in the before two;
        </p>

        <p>
            Those figures that stalk thier victims as they walk home, to school, or to none of the above so as to conceal any location to which the victim daily retires.
        </p>

        <p>
            Those creeps. Those criminals. Those thieves. Those predators. Those perverts. Those... people. Those... humans.
        </p>

        <p>
            But who dare not empathize with their victims, whom through a kitchen sink of tactics avoid victimhood?
        </p>

        <p>
            Those with whom no one, neither initiated woman nor initiated man, ever though to empathize: the uninitiated, innocent man.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Initiated women's earbuds seem to come loose in front of them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Initiated men's shoe laces seem to unravel in front of them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Initiated women's feet seem to tire ... and slow down in front of them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Initiated men's phones prompt a sharp left turn ... to the other side of the road in front of them.
        </p>

        <p>
            We all, initiated and uninitiated, know too well the consummate fear that takes hold when one of them approaches from behind. You've read the stories. The fear is inevitable.
        </p>

        <p>
            But let's enter the soul of the uninitiated, innocent man. Ándale, let's walk.
        </p>

        <p>
            You feel a palpable tension sieze the air when you're behind your victim.
        </p>

        <p>
            You feel the need to make a sharp right turn ... to the other side of the road when you're behind your victim.
        </p>

        <p>
            You feel your feet rejuvenate ... and speed up when you're behind your victim.
        </p>

        <p>
            With every step you feel more and more conflicted, because you know the societal cost of walking in your shoes isn't reason enough for the victims and the weary to change their behavior.
        </p>

        <p>
            After all, you're uninitiated ... and happen to be innocent. Unfortunate.
        </p>

        <p>
            ----------------------------------------------
        </p>
        <p>
            You, initiated ones, wanted emotion. Here, you ... never mind.
