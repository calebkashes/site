            <b> (03/04/2025) In 200 words: Tariff Tuesday </b>
            <br><br>
            Let’s forget China for a moment. Today, March 4th, a preliminary round of tariffs hit imports from Mexico
            and
            Canada.
            <br><br>
            President Trump floats this executive power to enact tariffs as an ace up his sleeve — a trump card, if you
            will
            — in a concerted effort to advance his foremost policy goal of border protection. What a few months ago
            seemed
            to be campaign noise is now a strong signal.
            <br><br>
            I’ve been alarmed by the nonchalance of many Wall Street strategists in light of this. Optimism and market
            sentiment led analysts to ignore the fact that the S&P 500 traded at a 25x multiple in mid-December — the
            median
            year-end forecast for the index was 6,600 just before January's inauguration.
            <br><br>
            The recent turbulence doesn’t invalidate those year-end estimates, however from my meager vantage point, the
            realization of President Trump’s economic policies was a stumbling block too tall to overlook, and yet the
            market has.
            <br><br>
            Beyond the tariff fallout and retaliation, I imagine the resolution of the Russia-Ukraine war will dictate
            any broad market movement in the week to come, i.e. for better or worse, views on the United States and its
            relation to world order will take center stage.
            <br>

        Although I wish I could, I can’t see four moves ahead. I used these sources to determine the best path forward:
