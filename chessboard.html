        <p>

            Another close relative (“Bishop”) asked me whether or not I viewed Nvidia (NYSE: NVDA) as a good investment, and here were my thoughts — in 200 words.
        </p>
        
        <p>

            Wednesday, NVDA’s ascent drove its market cap above the $3T mark, a threshold just two other (tech) companies have reached. NVDA beats earnings projections quarter-after-quarter, stands far above its competition in a novel, well-funded market, and remains under the stewardship of Jensen Huang, its admirable founder who hasn’t received the acclaim fellow tech giants Bill Gates and Steve Jobs have garnered. 
        </p>
        
        <p>

            I told Bishop that a position in NVDA wouldn’t be a bad move at all, more so if the objective is to profit from the current wave. I do believe growth will hit a natural plateau at some point, and I would pay close attention to NVDA’s own rhetoric to know when this might appear. 
        </p>
        
        <p>

            The great part about the NVDA story is that there haven’t been internal conflicts, overblown expectations, or antitrust violations to draw attention away from the technological innovation the company’s helped spark. It struggled in times past, not undue for products of the Silicon Valley venture scene, but I don’t think many investors can resist exposure in good faith.

        <br> <b> <u> In 200 words: ECB Policy Move</u> [Wednesday, June 5th, 2024] </b> <br>

        <p>
            
            European central bankers have “widely telegraphed” their policy move tomorrow: deposit rates will fall 25bps to 3.75% from 4.00%. So, then, how does this affect foreign exchange? I expect slight downward pressure on the Euro relative to the dollar because of a balance of payments shift, however the ECB doesn’t seem too bothered by spot rate fluctuations; their chief concern has been the Eurozone’s discrete economic growth.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            
            Apart from the direct exchange rate dynamic, the policy divergence tomorrow’s rate cut will effectuate between central bankers on either side of the Atlantic is significant in and of itself, since it’s often the Federal Reserve who captains rate paths. On this occasion, divergence is logical: the halt to U.S. disinflation and flooded labor market advise against a similar move from the Federal Open Market Committee for at least next week’s June assembly. Economic conditions in Sweden and Canada could also be prime for an ease to borrowing costs soon, so the year-end might usher forth a landscape in which domestic $USD financial markets offer global investors (more) outsized returns relative to home markets, but this prognostic depends on quite unpredictable inflation behavior— we’ll leave that for another 200 words.

        <br> <b> <u> In 200 words: EU Parliamentary Elections</u> [Tuesday, June 4th, 2024] </b> <br>

        <p>

            Three important issues pervade this summer’s European Parliamentary elections: immigration policy, climate change provisions, and the Ukraine/Russia conflict. In particular, the Eurozone’s tiresome diversification away from Russian energy hinted at the difficulties MEPs must overcome to realize the Green Deal (enacted early 2020), and many citizens have begun to raise questions over the ambitious net-zero emissions plan’s efficacy. 
        </p>

        <p>

            That said, the composition of the 720-member forum — which lacks true legislative power — appears to be on the brink of change, and coalitions between the center-right and far-right figureheads could induce a clear shift in the Eurozone’s middleground. Continental economic growth has stammered, evinced by an imminent ECB rate cut this Thursday, and internal discord among MEPs may further blight the consensus on regional progress. This doesn’t ruin all hopes for market participants though, as we’ve seen multiples expand and earnings receive upgrades across the MSCI Europe Index. It’s just that these positive data points aren’t concentrated in events on the continent. 
        </p>

        <p>
            
            Weekend results will affect Eurozone sentiment, however the fundamental picture requires a jolt from somewhere beyond Brussels. To that point, a potential rightward shift could offer insight into November’s U.S. Presidential election  — that discussion warrants another 200 words.

        <br> <b> <u> In 200 words: Saudi Aramco</u> [Monday, June 3rd, 2024] </b> <br>
        <p>

            A close relative (“Rook”) asked me to substantiate his potential investment in Saudi Aramco’s stock offering, and I suggested this move — in 200 words.  
		</p>
        
        <p>

            To provide better guidance, I wanted to know for which reasons Rook wanted exposure to Saudi Aramco: Rook believed the firm’s market power and scale would generate profitable operations, and he viewed their recent stock offering as a rare chance to enter a position; Rook wanted to hold the position for 2-3 years. 
        </p>
        
        <p>

            I steered Rook clear of Saudi Aramco because I believe Western oil majors warrant their valuations more and are better positioned to capitalize on short-term prospects given global diversification efforts and the geopolitical climate. To be specific, ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) isn’t far removed from record profits in 2022 and acquired Pioneer this May to expand their Permian Basin footprint. Also, given expectations for elevated American travel figures, soft crude prices (for the moment), and OPEC’s determination to quota supply, I see strong performance for U.S. oil and gas companies on the horizon. These factors, as well as XOM’s disparate production streams and growth opportunities beyond the legacy oil business, led me to earmark XOM and advise against Rook’s investment in Saudi Aramco.
