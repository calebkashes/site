			In 200 words: Saudi Aramco [Monday, June 3rd, 2024] <br>

            A close relative (“Rook”) asked me to substantiate his potential investment in Saudi Aramco’s stock offering, and I suggested this move — in 200 words.  
		</p>
        
        <p>

            To provide better guidance, I wanted to know for which reasons Rook wanted exposure to Saudi Aramco: Rook believed the firm’s market power and scale would generate profitable operations, and he viewed their recent stock offering as a rare chance to enter a position; Rook wanted to hold the position for 2-3 years. 
        </p>
        
        <p>

            I steered Rook clear of Saudi Aramco because I believe Western oil majors warrant their valuations more and are better positioned to capitalize on short-term prospects given global diversification efforts and the geopolitical climate. To be specific, ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM) isn’t far removed from record profits in 2022 and acquired Pioneer this May to expand their Permian Basin footprint. Also, given expectations for elevated American travel figures, soft crude prices (for the moment), and OPEC’s determination to quota supply, I see strong performance for U.S. oil and gas companies on the horizon. These factors, as well as XOM’s disparate production streams and growth opportunities beyond the legacy oil business, led me to earmark XOM and advise against Rook’s investment in Saudi Aramco.

            Although I wish I could, I can’t see four moves ahead. I used these sources to determine the best path forward:
